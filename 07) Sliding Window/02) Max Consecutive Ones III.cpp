Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.


class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();

        int zeroes = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        // Sliding Window 
        while(j < n){
            if(nums[j] == 0) zeroes++;

            while(zeroes > k){
                if(nums[i] == 0) zeroes--;
                i++;
            }

            maxi = max(maxi,j-i+1);
            j++;
        }

        return maxi;
    }
};
